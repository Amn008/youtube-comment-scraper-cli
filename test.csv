With this Problem, I suspect one of the Pulleys is out of line and I hope the Fellow checked the Alignment. Belts travel Billions of Feet a Year so a spare set is good to have with you. On later on owning a New Truck, I would not want to have a New Truck more than say 4/5 Years. Why? Components change so often like lower resistance Tires, Carbon Fibre Frame Rails one day and so on. A Person needs to buy new to get the Benefits of all this. And in a few Years it is likely an all Electric Truck will be available like the Nickola. If Diesels are still made for Trucking in 15 Years, they will be much smaller and lighter to stay in the March to save Fuel! You wouldn't want a Truck getting 5 MPG when 15 MPG is available with a new Truck!! I can also see our Lousy Stinking Governments coming up with mandatory Rules that may say, any Truck over 5 Years old will not be allowed on the Road. The days of running something for ever may well be gone! And then there is the other Ting.......perhaps People get tired of running the same Hardware day after day and look forward to the new Chariot!! The next time you have the Truck into your own Shop, have one of the Servicemen throw a Ruler on the front Faces of the Pulleys to make sure one of them is not out of Alignment. One or two out of Alignment means the Belt is forced to do sideways Work as well as just pulling! By the time  you are back Home, the Belts should be checked again for correct Tightness.....a good time to look at Alignment using a 3 Foot Ruler.",0,"7 months ago",1489529352606,false,false,,,
